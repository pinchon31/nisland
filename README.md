# nisland
nisland Python package - Version 0.1.  This package (nisland.py) allows to compute with Python 2.7 the theoretical cdf  (cumulative distribution function) and the IICR functions of the Tk coalescence times for the n-island model. The 'test_nisland' Python notebook gives some examples of using the main functions of this package.
A similar package continent (continent.py) for the continent-island model, built with the same method is now added.
